# Welcome to Clint Cain's code & whatever blog

Sometimes, I come up with ideas I think is great :smile:, I attempt execute some in code, others fall by the way side due to the life's challenges. Recently chatting with another dev, he asked, "why don't you blog?" since it appears to him, I have a lot to say. I said "why?", he said, "So others know how you think", which got me thinking. 

Still I didn't know how or where to start even though I have several wordPress blog sites :smile:. I created an account on gitHub to share and collaborate on code with others then realized this is probably the best place to blog. 
 
I'll share code sippets and some of my recent pet projects hope it helps someone and probably talk about industry nuisances, So here we go:
